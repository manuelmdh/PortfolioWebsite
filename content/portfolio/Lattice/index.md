The scope of the project is to find an application and incorporate lattice structure to a design using Netfabb.

The lattice structure chosen was a Re-entrant Honey Comb, which is an auxetic structure. This type of structure exhibits a negative poisonâ€™s ratio, making it ideal for energy absorption and deformation resistance. The lattice topology was extracted by importing a CAD file of a Re-entrant Honeycomb lattice cell. Then finally applied to the desired volume of the original shoe sole.
