We redesigned a door hinge expected to withstand a force of 63.75 lb, while following the design requirements; parts must be made of PLA and must fit on the testing rig. Multiple prototypes where allowed to take advantage of 3D printing design cycle.

We opted for generative design to test the FDM printer capability to print complex organic shapes. After testing each iteration the target weight parameters was reduced, also the preserve regions radius was increased. For printing parameters a 90% Honeycomb infill pattern was chosen to further reduce the weight, the orientation of the part is YXZ in order to align the force to the anisotropic nature of FDM process.
